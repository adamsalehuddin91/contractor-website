Assalamualaikum / Hello! 👋

Saya nak update progress website Binaan Teguh:

🎉 *WEBSITE SUDAH SIAP & LIVE!*

Website link: https://binaanteguh.pages.dev/

✅ 5 pages lengkap (Home, About, Services, Gallery, Contact)
✅ Auto-loading gallery system
✅ Mobile responsive
✅ FREE hosting (Cloudflare Pages)
✅ SSL certificate (HTTPS secure)

*Status Sekarang*:
Website guna dummy content (contoh text & gambar). Perlu replace dengan maklumat sebenar syarikat untuk launch rasmi.

*Next Step*:
Saya dah prepare 2 dokumen untuk bantu you collect content:

2️⃣ *Google Drive Guide* - Cara upload gambar projek sendiri

Boleh saya share dokumen ni? You boleh review dan prepare content ikut masa lapang.

Expected time: 5-7 jam (boleh buat over 2-3 hari)

After dapat content, saya integrate dalam 40 minit, then website ready untuk launch! 🚀

Ada soalan tak? 😊
